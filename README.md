## Introduction

QuickShop Hikari is a Shop plugin that allows players to create Chest Shops to easily sell and buy items, without the
need for any commands.  
In fact, all commands in QuickShop are not even needed for normal gameplay.

This version of QuickShop ([Ghost-chu/QuickShop-Hikari][quickshop-hikari]) is a fork
from [PotatoCraft-Studio's version][quickshop-potato] which itself is a fork from the [Reremake][quickshop-ghostchu] of
the [original QuickShop][quickshop-original].

QuickShop Hikari is maintained by Ghost-Chu and has the goal to modernize the core content of QuickShop and adapt it to
the latest versions of Minecraft.
