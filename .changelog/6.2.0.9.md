# 6.2.0.9

## Major Changes

### Introduction of the Revamped Packet System
1. **About**:
    - A modular and scalable system for managing packets related to virtual display items in Minecraft.
    - Supports both ProtocolLib and PacketEvents libraries for greater flexibility.

2. **Custom Packet Factories**:
    - Modular implementation of `PacketFactory` for game versions 1.20.x and 1.21.x.
    - Packet types:
        - **Spawn Packet**: Spawns a virtual item entity at a specific location.
        - **Metadata Packet**: Updates the visual properties of virtual items.
        - **Velocity Packet**: Adds motion/velocity to entities (currently optional).
        - **Destroy Packet**: Removes the entity from the client view.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - Enhanced debug logs to trace packet-related issues.
    - Detailed error messages for missing factories or unregistered listeners.

#### Improvements:
- Better modular design to facilitate support for future Minecraft versions.

#### Deprecations:
- Legacy packet handling mechanisms replaced with this new Packet System.
