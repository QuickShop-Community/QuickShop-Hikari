# 6.2.0.8

## Major Changes
- Added initial Folia Support
- CONTROL_PANEL_UI is a new interaction that allows you to use a GUI control panel instead of the chat one.
  - From this GUI you can add/remove staff, transfer ownership, set selling mode of shop, change the price and delete the shop!
- Readded QS History GUI
- Removed Real Item and Entity displays; They provided no advantages over virtual displays and mainly caused issues.
  - If protocol lib is not up-to-date/installed it will default to no display.

## Minor Changes
- Added 2 new interaction behaviours that will be coming soon. CONTROL_PANEL_UI and TRADE_UI
- Made it so that when price change fees are set to 0, the fee charge message isn't sent.

## Compat Plugins

### SuperiorSkyblock
- Made it so the compat plugin can delete shops when someone is banned from an island.
