    __to_translators: 'To translators: `addon.discord.discord-messages` use a special variable in strings, %%LANG_KEY%% instead of QuickShop''s style {LANG_INDEX}, do not translate anything inside double ''%'' section. BUT for any other section texts, it respect the normal QuickShop Text System syntax ({0},{1} etc.) This may be difficult to understand because two different variable forms are used in the same program at the same time, but trust me, it is reasonable. (you don''t need translate this string, it''s a comment)'
    __to_users: Like the QuickShop Text System, Discord addon will also auto-detect user language and use user's language to send Discord message, it following the QuickShop-Hikari's language system settings.
